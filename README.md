# Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction for Loan Approval

## Overview
Smart Lender is a machine learning-based solution aimed at enhancing the credit system in the banking sector. It focuses on predicting the eligibility of loan applicants, thus aiding banks in reducing financial risks and losses associated with loan defaults.

## Problem Statement
The credit system, a critical component of the financial sector, greatly influences the economy. An essential aspect of this system is the evaluation of credit risk, which is a complex and crucial task for banks. A significant challenge is the prediction of credit defaulters. Incorrect assessments can lead to financial losses for banks and affect their economic contributions. 

The primary issue addressed by Smart Lender is the difficulty applicants face in understanding the eligibility criteria for loans. This lack of clarity leads to inefficiencies, where both applicants and banks waste time on loan applications that are destined to be rejected due to eligibility mismatches.

## Target Audience
The primary beneficiaries of this system are:
- Applicants applying for loans in banks.
- Banking institutions seeking efficient and accurate methods to assess loan eligibility.

## Solution
Smart Lender proposes a web application that predicts an applicant's eligibility for a loan. This prediction is based on a comparison of the applicant's details with the bank's loan eligibility criteria.

## Methodology
The core of Smart Lender's predictive capability lies in the use of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms analyze past data to determine an applicant's eligibility for a loan. This approach aims to streamline the loan application process, reducing the time and resources spent on ineligible applications.
